This simulation runs through every possible game, and accumulates how often each game result occurs. Obviously it doesn't have much applicability to the real world since each player passes up obvious win opportunities. However, it also keeps track of who is able to force a win from each position, and correctly comes to the conclusion that neither is able to.
